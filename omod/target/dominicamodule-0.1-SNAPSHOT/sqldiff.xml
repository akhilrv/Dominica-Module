	<!-- This entry is run at module startup.  If the global property called "patientnotes.database_version" in the database
	     doesn't exist or is less than 0.1, then this "diff" is run.  If the value of that GP is greater than or equal to 0.1, 
	     then this won't be run.  Immediately after running this diff, openmrs sets the patientnotes.database_version GP to 0.1  -->
